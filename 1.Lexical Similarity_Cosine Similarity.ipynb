The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive."

    "This is similar to the multinomial naive bayes but the predictors are boolean variables. The parameters that we use to predict the class variable take up only values yes or no, for example if a word occurs in the text or not.\n",
